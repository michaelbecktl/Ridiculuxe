# Boilerplate: Fullstack with Sass

## Introduction

This project is the final group project that's a part of our Software Development bootcamp in Dev Academy Aotearoa. Ridiculuxe is a mock e-Commerce website that's created to visualize a luxury page designed for premium products that deserve it's own style of product presentation per product. The objective of this project was also to solidify our skills in 3D and animation frameworks such as React Three (ThreeJS) and Motion. We took this as an opportunity to exercise our creative abilities in Front-End design, with an MVP in site for a website with working REST APIs and user authentication systems.
